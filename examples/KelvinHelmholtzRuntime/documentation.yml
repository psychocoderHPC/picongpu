--- # Run-Time Tests for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Example
test:
  - growthRate:
      name:        Kelvin-Helmholtz e-/e+ Growth Rate Test
      description: |
                   This test runs the simulation with an electrons-positrons
                   gas and measures the growth rate of the characteristic B_z
                   field over time.
                   This is a very crutal test to see if the plasma dynamics
                   comes up right.
