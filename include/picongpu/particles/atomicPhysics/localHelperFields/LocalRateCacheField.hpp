/** @file implements a super cell local cache of no-change transition rates for each
 *      atomic state of a species.
 *
 * no-change atomic physics transition rates(diagonal elements of rate matrix) are expensive
 *  to calculate and all have to be calculated anyway for the adaptive time step calculation.
 *
 * Therefore the are only calculated for all atomic states once per atomicPhysics substep
 *  and cached for use in the rate solver.
 *
 * Since no-change transition rates depend on the local electron spectrum, as well as all
 *  transition's parameters, they are super cell local, same as the electron spectrum.
