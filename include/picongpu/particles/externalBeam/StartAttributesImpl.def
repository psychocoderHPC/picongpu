             *
             * Set the in cell position, the weighting, momentum and phase of a macro particle
             * created as a part of an external particle beam, that is entering the simulation box.
             *
             * The method numberOfMacroParticles provides the number of new particles that need to be created in
             * a cell.
             *
             * This Functor should be used together with a low level functor
             * like particles::startPosition::generic::FreeBoundary that ensures that the particles are created
             * only on the simulation external boundary.
             *
             *  It is impossible to differentiate between newly created and already previously present particles
             *  after the KernelFillGridWithParticles has run. Hence, when particles are initialized during the
             *  simulation and not only before the 0th step (when no previous particles exist), all initial
             *  attributes need to be already set in KernelFillGridWithParticles. That's why this functor wraps
             *  around a start position functor (setting weighting, position and also providing the
             *  numberOfMacroParticles method) and combines it with other sub-functors. Each sub-functor is
             *  responsible for one additional attribute ( currently momentum and phase).
             *
             *  All sub-functors (beside start position functor) should be default constructible and have  a
             * host-device init method (takes the low level functor as a reference parameter). The start position
             * functor should have a constructor which takes currentStep (uint32_t) as an only parameter.
             *
             *
             * @tparam T_StartPositionFunctor functor used to set particle position and weighting. It should
             *      provide a numberOfMacroParticles method.
             * @tparam T_MomentumFunctor functor used to set particle initial momentum.
             * @tparam T_PhaseFunctor functor used to set particle initial phase. Use initPhase::NoPhase
             *      for particles without a phase.
