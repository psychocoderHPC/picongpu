# The current distribution strategy in openpmd-pipe is to simply subdivide each
# dataset into n equal-sized hyperslabs
# As a consequence, communication will not necessarily happen within a node
# Implicit node-level aggregation via streaming is independent from distribution
# strategy that is used, since the deciding factor is that there is only one
# instance of openpmd-pipe writing data per node. It does not matter that this
# data does not necessarily stem from the same node.
# Also, since ADIOS2 SST does currently not use any intra-node infrastructure
# for streaming, this distribution strategy performs roughly equivalently to
# strategies that keep communication in one node.
